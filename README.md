# 11.2-Selection-Sort

**Java Programming Assignment: Implementing Selection Sort**

**Objective:**
Students will implement the selection sort algorithm in Java and demonstrate its correctness by sorting an array of integers.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a Java class named `SelectionSort`.
2. Implement a static method `selectionSort(int[] array)` that sorts the array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.
3. The method should:
   - Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array.
   - Swap it with the first unsorted element.
   - Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted elements.
4. Write a `main` method to:
   - Initialize an integer array with at least 10 unsorted values.
   - Call the `selectionSort` method.
   - Print the array before and after sorting.
5. Ensure proper formatting, meaningful variable names, and comments explaining each step.

**Bonus Challenge:**
Modify the `selectionSort` method to sort the array in descending order if a boolean parameter `ascending` is set to `false`.

**Example Output:**
```
Original Array: [29, 10, 14, 37, 13]
Sorted Array: [10, 13, 14, 29, 37]
```

**Submission Requirements:**
- Submit the Java file named `SelectionSort.java`.
- Ensure the code compiles and runs correctly.
- Comment your code to explain the logic used.
- Include test cases for different input arrays.

**Grading Criteria:**
- Correct implementation of the selection sort algorithm (40 points)
- Proper use of loops and conditionals (20 points)
- Code readability and comments (20 points)
- Successful execution with different test cases (20 points)
